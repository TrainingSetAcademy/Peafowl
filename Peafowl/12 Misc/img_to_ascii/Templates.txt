ASCII Generator HTML Templates
------------------------------

The ASCII Generator supports the automatic creation of html files through the use of templates.  These are html files containing a tag that the program replaces with the ASCII picture, a system defined value, or a user-defined value.  Just create a html page like you normally would, then add one of the following tags in the place you want that item to appear.  See the file 'Example Template.html' for a very basic example.

The html tags are in the format:
 <ASCGEN tag-name>

Where the tag can be one of the following:

 <ASCGEN title>
 <ASCGEN name>
 <ASCGEN email>
 <ASCGEN link1>
 <ASCGEN link2>
 <ASCGEN link3>
 <ASCGEN var1>
 <ASCGEN var2>
 <ASCGEN var3>
 <ASCGEN var4>
 <ASCGEN var5>

 <ASCGEN picture>		The text picture currently in the richedit
 <ASCGEN ascgen-home>		Address of the ASCGEN home page
 <ASCGEN text-col>		Text colour in hexadecimal format (eg. #FFFFFF)
 <ASCGEN background-col>	Background colour in hexadecimal format (eg. #000000)
 <ASCGEN day>			Number representing the current day of the month
 <ASCGEN day-of-week>		Current day of the week
 <ASCGEN short-day-of-week>	Current day of the week in three characters
 <ASCGEN month>			Number from 1-12 representing the current month
 <ASCGEN month-string>		Name of the current month
 <ASCGEN short-month-string>	Three character name of the current month
 <ASCGEN year>			Current year
 <ASCGEN short-year>		Last two digits of current year
 <ASCGEN ddmmyy>		Current system date in dd/mm/yy format
 <ASCGEN ddmmyyyy>		Current system date in dd/mm/yyyy format
 <ASCGEN mmddyy>		Current system date in mm/dd/yy format
 <ASCGEN mmddyyyy>		Current system date in mm/dd/yyyy format


Notes:
 - The eleven tags in the top section are all user definable and the names given are just suggestions.  All of those tags, except the title, are stored to the registry.

 - Case is not important.

 - The tag must not span more than one line or it will be ignored.

 - Let me know if there are any extra tags that you think should be supported.
