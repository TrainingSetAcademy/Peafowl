ASCII Generator Public Beta 13
------------------------------------------------------------
The old website is no more, and the domain name is lost.  But, you should always be able to find us via one of these addresses:
http://go.to/ascgen/
http://www.users.totalise.co.uk/~wardog/
------------------------------------------------------------
Installation.
Simply create a new directory, and extract the contents of the zip file into it and create a shortcut to Ascgen.exe.  Alternatively, as the program does not require any extra files, it can be executed directly from the zip archive.
------------------------------------------------------------
What's new?
Due to recent events, there are no new major features.  This release fixes several small bugs and irritations (ie the ASCII banner text now works as expected), while adding a few new features.
------------------------------------------------------------
Known problems
A small number of people reported a 'Divide By Zero' error that happens after they click Ok on the conversion form.  I haven't been able to reproduce this on any of the machines I have access to, but I was able to track down where it happens and stop it from crashing.

So, if the form pops back up after you press 'Ok', or you get a strange error message, here's the work around
 - Click on the 'Advanced Settings' Tab, and uncheck 'ASCGEN Ramp'.
 - Copy and Paste this whole string into the character ramp listbox (you may need to set word wrap off):
@@@@@@@######MMMBBHHHAAAA&&GGhh9933XXX222255SSSiiiissssrrrrrrr;;;;;;;;:::::::,,,,,,,........        
 - Press ok and it should work.

(The output won't be as good as it would have been, but it's better then nothing)
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a public beta release of the ASCII Generator or ASCGEN (pronounced A-S-C-Gen), and is therefore not guaranteed to work on your system (but it should).  Please send me an email if you like the program, or can see anything that needs fixing/adding/etc.

You are encouraged to mirror this zip file, and pass it around to your friends.  If you upload it to a good server then please send the address to <ascgen@go.to> and I'll add it to the list on the web site.  People who mirror the ASCGEN will receive a link to the new file days before it is put on the website.  Do not alter this zip file in any way, and you must not place this on a cover cd/published cd collection/etc without my express permission.

To receive an email when a new beta version is available, send a blank email to <ascgen@go.to> with 'Subscribe' in the title.  You will only receive one email shortly after a new version is uploaded and verified, you will not receive any spam.

All other comments/suggestions/etc should go to <ascgen@go.to> or be posted on the guestbook linked to from the web page.  This is a beta version, so let me know of any problems or good/bad points or they might never be improved or fixed.  Please make sure you are using the latest version _before_ sending me a bug report.
